This is a project for class Exploratory Data Analysis/Visualizations at Columbia University. Our team presents interactive visualizations and interesting insights into the Airbnb data of NYC. We are willing to choose Airbnb for accommodations when traveling because of its low cost, convenient location, and household amenities. We focus on New York Cityâ€™s data because we live in New York and we love this amazing city. Thus, we wish to perform an in-depth data analysis on one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world.
